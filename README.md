## Tips for Better Results

### **Writing Effective Prompts**

 **Do:**
- Be specific about your topic
- Mention your target audience

- Ask multiple unrelated questions
- Expect analysis without enough data

### **Interpreting Results**

- **Perplexity Enhanced = Yes**: Report includes real-time trending topics from across the web
- **Perplexity Enhanced = No**: Report based solely on scraped posts (still valuable!)
- Check the **posts analyzed** count - more posts = more reliable insights
- Look for patterns across multiple engagement targets

### **Taking Action**

1. Start with **Next Steps** - prioritized action items
2. Review **Engagement Targets** - real people you can connect with
3. Test **Strategic Recommendations** one at a time
4. Track results and refine your approach

## Troubleshooting

### **"Analysis timed out"**
- Normal for very large datasets (150+ posts)
- Try a more specific prompt to reduce data volume
- Check back in a few minutes - it may still complete

### **"No posts found"**
- Your prompt may be too specific
- Try broader keywords
- Check if the topic exists on the platforms we search

### **"Low quality score"**
- Not enough relevant posts found
- Refine your prompt to be more specific
- Try a different mode if you're in the wrong niche

### **"Perplexity Enhanced: No"**
- We had enough scraped posts (>50) so didn't need external data
- Not an error - your report is still valuable!
- Trending topics are a bonus, not required
